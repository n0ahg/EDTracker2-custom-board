EDTracker2-custom-board
=======================

This is the Arduino IDE v1.5.6r2 custom board I built for EDTracker2.

Simply drop in to your Documents\Arduino\Hardware directory and after restarting the IDE you can select 'ED Tracker' in the boards menu to develop on a Arduino Leonardo (or clone) with a MPU-6150 and the custom USB HID profile used for EDTracker2.
